# Instructions

## Numbers and Cards (parts 1 and 2)

 Most of the code for parts 1 and two are within their respective classes in `models.js`.  To run parts 1.1-2.2, just uncomment the line invoking `main()` in `app.js` and reload the `index.html`.

## Pokemon (part 3)

I spent long enough working on this that I didn't really feel like building a separate page for this section.  You can run the following lines of code in the Chrome dev tools:

```JavaScript
const pokemon = new Pokemon
pokemon.catchEmAll()
pokemon.pick3()
```

## Follow-Up

- [ ] Capitalize the first letter in the Pokemon's name when logging
- [ ] Make sure that the flavor text is in English
